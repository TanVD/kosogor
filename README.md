# Kosogor

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/TanVD/kosogor.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/TanVD/kosogor)

The idea behind Kosogor project is to reduce the size of your build.gradle.kts and remove from it all the boilerplate: 
setting plugins configurations, which should be defaults or using verbose plugin interfaces when you don't need such flexibility.

It includes a few different plugins:
* `kosogor` &mdash; simplified Kotlin-DSL facades and defaults for everyday development. See it's [README](https://github.com/TanVD/kosogor/blob/master/kosogor).
* `kosogor-terraform` &mdash; support of Terraform in Gradle â€” from modules publish to deployment. See it's [README](https://github.com/TanVD/kosogor/blob/master/kosogor-terraform).
* `kosogor-web` &mdash; tasks and facades simplifying Web development (from War preparation to Js minification). See it's [README](https://github.com/TanVD/kosogor/blob/master/kosogor-web).
* `kosogor-zkm` &mdash; Gradle wrapper for ZKM-based obfuscation, clean and simple.  See it's [README](https://github.com/TanVD/kosogor/blob/master/kosogor-zkm).

## More?

The priority of Kosogor project is to make Gradle simple and concise for everyday use. Feel free to add issues on extending
Kosogor with facades for the plugins/systems you use. Probably such issues will be implemented in Kosogor itself
or deriving plugins will occur (like `kosogor-zkm` already exists).
